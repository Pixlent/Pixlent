Hi, I'm pixlent; your average self-thought dev who occasionaly makes some cool stuff.
I normally just develop anything that sounds interesting to me, like
- ⛏️ Minecraft plugins and servers using Java
- 🕹️ Games using Godot
- 🖥️ Home server for self hosting and downloaded media

I'm also often technical support for- well, everyone I know.
